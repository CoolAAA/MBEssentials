[mushy] /freeze <playername> - stops the player from moving and breaking/placing. handy for if someone is griefing!

[AAAA][DONE] Money system using /balance and /pay <playername> maybe even an API that other plugins can use! :D

[AAAA][DONE] Api for the money system

*Antigrief - disable blocks and tools. ( abes could do that)

[AAAA]*Advancsd logging features - log Deaths, pvp, commands etc to individual .Txt files in the Mbessentials folder

[Everyone]*Config system - enable/disable Any feature of MBEssentials you want.

[mushy] [wip] create a website for the plugin, along with all commands, permissions and description!

[Abiram] some kind of jail system @coords: -10000,120,-10000 , so nobody will have issues with this jailbuilding thing xD

[AAAA] When you report players (using /report) it is logged in a .txt file in the MBessentials directory, so server owners can
  find it easily!

[AAAA] More api stuff - not quite sure what, but it will make our plugin more popular if we have a bigger api! I am currently
  trying to understand how it works, so I will start contributing as soon as possible!
  
 * Built in custom command support - AAAA you could just use the plugin you already made!

[AAAA]Autoupdater - I will provide with D/L links as soon as possible, as the website is under contruction - 

Any other ideas? - mushy
