       if run from player it will kick everybody but the player who ran it.

[Mushy] Added a placeholder for /tpto <playername> /tphere <playername> and /freeze <playername>

[Mushy] Changed some things on plugin startup

[Mushy] Changed stuff so that it mentions abiram!

[Mushy] Added nice, sweet message when the server shuts down! :)

[Mushy] Added comand /tpto <playername> - This is designed to make teleporting easier. This will teleport the player to <playername>
        requires: mbes.cmds.tpto

[Mushy] Re-orginised some stuff to make sure that the packages and imports work correctly!

[AAAA] Fixed a small package misspell in /tpto and added a check to see if the command is        beingran from the console. And if the player arg was not entered. So errors don't occur.
