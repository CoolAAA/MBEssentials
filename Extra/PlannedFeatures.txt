-MBESSENTIALS-PLANNED FEATURES-
-------------------------------

* BEFORE THE FEATURE MEANS IT HAS NOT BEEN "CLAIMED" YET

-- Not Yet Started --

[Mushy] Nickname system - Allows you to set your nickname to anything (such as TheMushyPeas to DatCoolGuy) I will add a prefix to nicknames so that you know it is not the acutal person
[AAAA] When you report players (using /report) it is logged in a .txt file in the MBessentials directory, so server owners can
  find it easily!
[AAAA] More api stuff - not quite sure what, but it will make our plugin more popular if we have a bigger api! I am currently
  trying to understand how it works, so I will start contributing as soon as possible!  
[Abiram] some kind of jail system @coords: -10000,120,-10000 , so nobody will have issues with this jailbuilding thing xD
[AAAA] Block kits so whenever you break a block that is a kit block it will drop the items that it was set to 
* /tpa and /tpaccept (the Minecraft command)
----------------------

-- Work in Progress --

[AAAA][WIP]Autoupdater - I will provide with D/L links as soon as possible, as the website is under contruction - 
[Mushy][WIP] create a website for the plugin, along with all commands, permissions and description!
[Everyone][WIP]Config system - just fill in config details as you go along!
[Mushy][WIP] Kit system - allows for the creation of kits, as well as the option to set a default kit that everyone will get when they first join.

-----------------------

-- Finished --

[AAAA][DONE] /freeze <playername> - stops the player from moving and breaking/placing. handy for if someone is griefing!
