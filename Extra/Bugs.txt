// Put any known bugs here, so that they can be fixed.

// Example: [ModCmds.java] x happens when x is executed

[ReportManager.java] The report number keeps increasing every time even if you delete a report i 
                     know how to fix it i just haven't had the time to.
                      
I did a big bug testing session: Here are my results:

*/unmute doesnt work
*If a muted player disconnects, they are unmuted when they relog
*The freeze commands dont work
*The word replacer doesnt seem to work
*The block and unblock commands dont seem to work

I have NOT investigated further into these bugs, it was just what I saw. Otherwise, the plugin works perfect!
